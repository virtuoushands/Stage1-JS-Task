# Stage1-JS-Task
Submission of my first task in Front End course in Javascript class @startng2020
Practice on using variables and array: I used the variable to define/state my name
I used the array to list my courses.
I also created a loop making use of odd numbers from 1-200 since the total number of my course (3) is an odd number.
I had to study with the provided resources on W3schools which was mainly about learning to create a loop in javascript.
